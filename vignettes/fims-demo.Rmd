## Fisheries Integrated Modeling System
The Fisheries Integrated Modeling System (FIMS) is a modeling framework for fisheries stock assessment. It's important to note that FIMS is not a model, but rather a system for creating models. FIMS is made up of many modules that come together to create a stock assessment model that suites the needs of the enduser.
